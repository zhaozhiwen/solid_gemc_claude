# Project log

Chronological notes on this solid_gemc simulation project. Prepend the
most recent entry at the top. Each entry captures **what the user
asked for**, **what Claude planned**, **what the user decided**, and
**what actually happened**. Future Claude sessions read this to pick
up where you left off; the user reads it to remember why a particular
run exists.

Use the template below for each new entry. Keep prose tight — link to
specific `runs/<id>/` directories or analysis scripts rather than
quoting their contents.

### Request

> <verbatim user request, in their own words; quote it so future-you
>  can tell what was asked vs. what Claude inferred>

### Plan (six-field spec)

- Physics goal:    <…>
- SoLID config:    <PVDIS_LD2 / PVDIS_LH2 / SIDIS_He3 / J_psi / …>
- Beam:            <particle, energy, n_events>
- GCard:           <preset + parameter overrides>
- Output:          `runs/<id>/out.root`
- Analysis:        <plot type, observable>
- Steps:           <e.g. config → run → analyze>
- Risks:           <only if real>

### Decision

<approved as-is | edited spec to <…> | wrote plan only, did not run>

### Outcome

- Run id:  `runs/<id>` (or "n/a — plan only")
- Status:  <succeeded | failed at <step> with <reason>>
- Notes:   <one or two lines: what worked, what surprised, what's next>
